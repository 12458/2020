## Circuit Programming
On 16 March 2020, We organised a workshop about Circuit Programming with Python using the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express. Participants range from complete beginners to having some experience in Python. In the workshop, participants learned beyond basic python, and had fun playing around with the circuit playground they received, and expanded on their creativity to utilise what they can do with the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express.
